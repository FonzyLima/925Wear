          Feel unbeatable from the tee box to the final putt in a design
          that&apos;s pure early MJ: speed, class and laden with true early 90s
          touches, like visible Air and a translucent plastic sole that stand
          the test of time. This model fuses the strut of MJ&apos;s first
          championship with some of our best golf technology, helping you make a
          statement of confidence when the time comes to tame the course.
